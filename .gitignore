# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle

# database config files
db/schema.rb
config/database.yml
/db/*.sqlite3

# Comment out these rules if you are OK with secrets being uploaded to the repo
config/initializers/secret_token.rb
config/secrets.yml

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp
